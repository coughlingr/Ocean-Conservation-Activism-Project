  <h1>Climate Change</h1>
  <h3>Greenhouse gases trap energy from the sun, so the oceans absorb more heat which results in rising sea surface temperatures and rising sea levels - this will lead to changes in the environment as we know it.
Warmer weather places will have a lot more tropical storms.
Floods will also be way more likely to happen, especially along the East Coast of the U.S.
At the rate of the current rising sea levels, some places like NYC, Honolulu, Hoboken, San Diego and Fort Lauderdale will be a few feet below sea level (underwater!) by 2050.
The ocean has observed so much warming from the climate, the effects are now measurable over 1,000 meters down.
This leads to ocean stratification - the prevention of water missing due to different molecular makeup in water masses; the top layer of water becomes warmer, lighter and less salter, while beneath the top layer the water becomes colder, heavier, and saltier.
This leads to more hurricanes and storms.
Climate change also causes an expansion in dead zones.
Glaciers and ice also melt due to warming - this causes rising sea levels, coastal erosion, human habitat destruction, and saltwater intrusion . </h3>

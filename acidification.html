  <h1>Acidification</h1>
  <h3>Acidification is the change of properties of ocean water that can harm plants and animals. The ocean is absorbing  carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and humans and is becoming more and more acidic every year. There needs to be a certain amount of acidity in the ocean for sea life to thrive, but the rate the acidity percentage is climbing will soon be deadly to sea life. Ocean water has become 30% more acidic in the past 100-200 years. Too much acidity will break down the shells of crustaceans, shellfish, and turtles. It will weaken coral and stunt its growth. Coral is essential to the ocean environment because it is an ecosystem for hundreds of different species. Also,  pteropod shells dissolve really quickly (within 45 days) when the ocean becomes more acidic. This is alarming because the pteropod is the base of the oceanic food chain so a shift in the specifics will affect the creatures on the ocean food chain. 
	The ocean absorbs 30% of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. When the carbon dioxide is absorbed by seawater, it causes a chemical reaction that affects the molecular makeup of the water. The carbon dioxide increases the amount of hydrogen ions in the water, and the more hydrogen ions there are in the water, the more acidic the ocean becomes. As the ocean is filled with more hydrogen ions and less carbon ions, it creates a chemical that affects marine organisms. It becomes harder for creatures with shells to build and maintain their shells, and it affects some fishes' natural tendencies to run away from predators, or mate (i.e. clownfish).  By the end of the century, the ocean will be as acidic as it was 17 million years ago; when the Earth was in an extinction period and blazing hot.
